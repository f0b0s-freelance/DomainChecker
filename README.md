DomainChecker
=============

DomainChecker
i have a big list of domains
on web20 sites, like wordpress.com tumblr.com blogspot.com
and what i need this scraper to do is:
go the registration page of each tumblr.com for example
and try to register an account there (fill in username)
if it shows as available, the app will mark that subdomain as available
and that's it, all it needs to do
